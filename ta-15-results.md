Your implementation is **well-structured**, cleanly written, and testable — great work! Below is a **review for correctness, best practices, and improvements**:

---

## ✅ **Correctness Review**

### ✅ Form Implementation

* Field validation works as intended: ✅
* Conditional rendering of error messages: ✅
* Form validity check before submission: ✅
* Submission resets fields and shows a success message: ✅
* Correct handling of controlled components: ✅

### ✅ Unit Tests

* Input rendering test: ✅
* Validation error messages checked correctly: ✅
* Submit button enablement logic tested: ✅
* Submission flow + thank-you message: ✅

## 🛠️ Code Review & Improvements

### 🔹 1. ❌ `break` after `return` in `validate`

This code is unreachable and should be removed:

```ts
case 'name':
    return isValidName(value) ? '' : 'Name should not be empty';
    break; // <-- unnecessary
```

✅ **Fix**: Just remove the `break` after `return`.

---

### 🔹 2. 🔁 Validation returns empty string instead of `undefined`

You're using this pattern:

```ts
return isValidName(value) ? '' : 'Name should not be empty';
```

But `''` counts as a value in `errors`, meaning:

```ts
if (error) newErrors[key] = error;
```

...adds empty strings as "errors", which may confuse logic.

✅ **Fix**: Use `undefined` for no-error, error string for error:

```ts
return isValidName(value) ? undefined : 'Name should not be empty';
```

Then your `isFormValid()` will be more reliable if changed to:

```ts
const isFormValid = (): boolean => {
    return (
        isValidName(data.name) &&
        isValidEmail(data.email) &&
        isValidMessage(data.message)
    );
};
```

### 🔹 3. 🧪 Test: `submit` test might fail after timeout

You reset `submitted` after `1s`, but the `thank-you` check happens after click. On slow CI, the `waitFor` could race the timeout.

✅ **Fix**: Increase wait time or disable the timeout in test mode (optional):

```ts
setTimeout(() => {
    setSubmitted(false);
}, 1000);
```

Option 1: Add a `testId` to the wrapper and assert in your test that all inputs are unmounted instead of waiting for state to revert.

---

### 🔹 4. ♻️ `isFormValid()` logic is slightly duplicated

You're validating both in `handleSubmit` and `isFormValid`. While not wrong, this could be DRY’d a bit by storing field validity flags in state or memoizing computed validity.

But for easy-level, this is acceptable.

### 🔹 5. 💅 Styling: `rounded-xs` is not a valid Tailwind class

```ts
className="bg-gray-100 text-black p-2 rounded-xs m-2"
```

✅ **Fix**: Use `rounded-sm`, `rounded-md`, etc.

## 🚀 Suggested Enhancements (Optional)

These aren't required, but good for growth:

* ✅ Add focus styles for accessibility.
* ✅ Add `aria-invalid` for screen readers when errors are shown.
* ✅ Add a `role="alert"` to error messages.
* ✅ Extract `Input` and `TextArea` to reusable components if reused elsewhere.
