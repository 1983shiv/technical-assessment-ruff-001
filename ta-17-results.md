# Quiz Technical Assessment Review (ta-17) â€” Revised

## 1. Quiz Context (`QuizContext.tsx`)

**Correctness:**
- Context and provider are implemented correctly and now include a `resetQuiz` function for restarting the quiz.
- `submitAnswer`, `nextQuestion`, and `resetQuiz` logic are clear and functional.
- Score increments only on correct answers; feedback is tracked per question.
- Prevents multiple submissions by using the `answered` flag.

**Best Practices:**
- Uses TypeScript interfaces for type safety.
- Context throws if used outside provider (good safety).
- State is well-structured and easy to extend.
- Uses `useMemo` to memoize the context value, improving performance and preventing unnecessary re-renders.
- All quiz state logic is encapsulated in the provider.

**Edge Cases:**
- Handles multiple questions, prevents double submission, tracks feedback, and now supports quiz reset/restart.
- Handles quiz completion and reset gracefully.

**Suggestions:**
- For even larger apps, consider a reducer for more complex quiz logic.
- Could add a loading state for async question fetching (future scalability).

## 2. Quiz Component (`Quiz.tsx`)

**Correctness:**
- Renders questions, choices, feedback, and score at the end.
- Disables submit button until a choice is selected and after submission.
- Feedback is shown with color coding (green/red) for correct/incorrect.
- Implements quiz reset button on completion, improving UX.

**Best Practices:**
- Uses semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility.
- Uses data-testid for robust testing.
- Resets local `selected` state on quiz reset for a clean restart.
- Could add keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter) for even better accessibility.
- Could show explanation or correct answer for learning value (optional).

**Suggestions:**
- Consider adding a progress indicator (e.g., "Question 2 of 5").
- Could add a confirmation dialog before resetting the quiz (optional UX polish).

## 3. Quiz Tests (`Quiz.test.tsx`)

**Correctness:**
- Tests cover rendering, answer submission, feedback, prevention of multiple submissions, and quiz completion.
- Uses React Testing Library and Vitest idiomatically.
- Uses beforeEach to DRY up render logic.

**Best Practices:**
- Each test is isolated and clear.
- Could add tests for edge cases (e.g., no questions, all correct/incorrect answers, reset behavior).
- Could add accessibility tests (tab order, ARIA roles).

**Suggestions:**
- Consider testing feedback color or content for correct/incorrect answers.
- Could test for score calculation accuracy and reset functionality.

## 4. General & UX

- Code is clean, readable, and idiomatic for a junior-level assessment.
- All required features and edge cases are covered, including quiz reset.
- Good use of TypeScript, React Context, and testing tools.
- Accessibility and UX are considered, but could be further improved for production (e.g., keyboard navigation, progress indicator).

**Overall:**
Excellent work for a junior-level technical assessment. The code is correct, maintainable, and follows best practices. The addition of reset functionality and useMemo for context value are strong improvements. Only minor enhancements are suggested for scalability, accessibility, and UX polish.

## 5. Performance Score

**Score: 10/10**

- For the current scale and requirements, performance is excellent.
- State updates are minimal and efficient.
- useMemo prevents unnecessary re-renders of consumers.
- No performance bottlenecks observed for this scale.
- For larger quizzes or async data, consider reducers and further memoization as needed.
